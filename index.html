    <h1>Cast Iron Pan Pizza Recipe</h1>
    <p>Hello, and welcome to my recipe for the world's best homemade pan pizza!</p>
    <p>What makes it the world's best? Cast iron is the perfect vehicle to get a pan pizza that's got a crust that's
        crispy on the outside, and chewy on the inside. My homemade pizza sauce will level up any pizza, not just this
        one. And the delicious toppings go all the way to the edges.</p>
    <h2>The Dough</h2>
    <p>We'll start with a homemade, no-knead, dough.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>400g bread flour</li>
        <li>10g kosher salt</li>
        <li>4g instant yeast</li>
        <li>275g water</li>
        <li>8g extra-virgin olive oil</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add all ingredients to a large bowl. Combine until there's no dry flour left.<br>No need to knead or
            anything close, a good mix with a wooden spoon will do!</li>
        <li>Cover the bowl tightly with plastic wrap.</li>
        <li>Let the dough rest at room temperature (but not too hot! it'll kill the yeast!) for 16 to 24 hours. The
            dough should triple, at least, in size.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Sauce</h2>
    <p>The most important part of any delicious pizza is a great sauce! Skip the sugar-laden canned stuff and make your
        own! </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow onion, diced</li>
        <li>3-4 cloves garlic (to taste), minced</li>
        <li>1 tbsp tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 28oz. can whole peeled San Marzano tomatoes</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
        <li>Freshly cracked black pepper</li>
        <li>Dried oragano</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the olive oil to a medium saucepan, and heat on medium.</li>
        <li>Add the onion and stir. Once the onions start to sweat, add the garlic.</li>
        <li>Once the garlic is fragrant, add the tomato paste, stir well, and turn the heat to meadium-high. Let the
            tomato paste caramelize for about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Add the whole tomoatoes and spices, stir well, and lower the heat to low. Allow the sauce to lightly simmer
            for about an hour.</li>
        <li>After about an hour, when the sauce is very fragrant and the tomatoes are falling apart, remove the sauce to
            the jar of a blender and blend for about 30 seconds, until the sauce reaches a consistent, but not perfectly
            smooth, consistency.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>The Toppings</h2>
    <p>Of course, the toppings you use can be the "chef's choice," but here's a good example of a traditional pan pizza.
    </p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Full-fat, low-moisture mozzarella cheese * <sup>see note</sup></li>
        <li>Loose italian sausage</li>
        <li>Sliced pepperoni</li>
        <li>Slice green bell pepper</li>
        <li>Sliced black olives</li>
    </ul>
    <p>You'll notice there's no quantities listed. That's really up to you, and how you like your pizza.</p>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Brown and crumble the sausage in separate skillet, making sure it is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Dice and slice the veggies, and shred your cheese.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Note about the cheese: you may be tempted to try fresh or fancy mozzarella. Resist that urge. It's too wet, and
        it'll make your pizza soggy. Go for the regular block in the grocery store diary case.</p>
    <h2>The Pizza!</h2>
    <p>Let's put it all together!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>The Dough</li>
        <li>The Sauce</li>
        <li>The Toppings</li>
        <li>Extra-virgin olive oil</li>
        <li>Parmesan cheese block</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Preparation:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Sprinkle a bit of flour on the top of your risen dough, a little on your hands, and a little on the counter.
            Turn out the dough and lightly punch it down. Split the ball of dough in to two--that's right, there's
            enough dough for two pizzas! Feel free to freeze the second ball in a Ziploc bag for next time.</li>
        <li>Pour about 2 tablespoons of extra-virgin olive oil on to a 9-inch cast iron pan. Place one of the dough
            balls on the oiled pan, and gently spread the dough out to the edges. It will bounce back some, and that's
            okay.</li>
        <li>Cover the pan and dough with plastic wrap, and allow it to rise for another 90 minutes.</li>
        <li>Preheat your oven to 550 degrees farenheight, or as high as it goes.</li>
        <li>Once the dough has rested it's 90 minutes, very gently again spread it to make sure it touches the edges of
            your cast-iron skillet.</li>
        <li>Top the dough: First the sauce, going all the way to the edge, then the cheese, again going all the way to
            the edges. Next the toppings, going--you guessed it!--all the way to the edge.</li>
        <li>Bake the pizza for 15 minutes, until the top is golden brown.</li>
        <li>Immediately after removing the pizza from the oven, grate a bit of parmesan right on to it.</li>
        <li>Enjoy the best pan pizza you've ever had!</li>
    </ol>
